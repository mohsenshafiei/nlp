#### Introduction to NLP

- Application of NLP
	* Spell Checking
	* Information Extraction
	* Keyword Search
	* Advertisement Matching
	* Sentimental Analysis
	* Speech Recognition
	* Chatbots
	* Machine Translation

- Components of NLP
	* Natural Language Understanding which includes 
		** Mapping input to useful representation
		** Analyzing different aspects of the language
	* Natural Language Generation
		** Text Planning
		** Sentence Planning
		** Text Realization
- Difficulties of NLU
	* Lexical Ambiguity
	* Syntactic Ambiguity
	* Referential Ambiguity

- Tooling
	* Natural Language Analysis with Python NLTK
- Tokenization
	* Break a complex sentence into words
	* Understand the importance of each of the words with respect to the sentence
	* Produce a structural description on an input sentence
	* Bigram, Trigram, NGram
- Stemming
	* Normalize words into its base form or root form
	
- Lemmatization
	* Groups together different inflected forms of a word, called Lemma
	* Somehow similar to Stemming, as it maps several words into one common root
	* Output of lemmatisation is a proper word
	* For example, a Lemmatiser should map gone, going and went into go
	
- Named Entity Recognition?
	* Movie
	* Monetary Value
	* Organization
	* Location
	* Quantites
	* Person

- NER Entities List
	* Geo-Socio-Political-Group
	* Geo-Political Entity
	* Facility
	* Location
	* Organization
	* Person

- Syntax Tree
	* Syntax Tree is a tree representation of syntactic structure of sentences or strings
	* ghostscirpt

- Chunking
	* Picking up Individual pieces of information and Grouping them into bigger Pieces
